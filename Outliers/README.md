## Outliers and Cleaning data

Cleaning data can be an ambiguous task as some outliers may actually be of significance whereas others might be errors. There are 2 types of such outliers:

1. Errors (Maybe due to Sensor malfunction or data entry)
2. Interesting points (An actual outlier in terms of consistency)

### Removing outliers
1. Train
2. Remove ~10% of the points based on residual errors
3. Train again

This has been demonstrated by the following graphs on the age_net-worth dataset:
