## Today I Learned

### Day 1 (26-11-2021) : Naive Bayes
- Started with the [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)  course on Udacity
- Learnt the basics of a Naive Bayes classifier on the `iris` dataset
- Working on classifying the `Stanley Terrain` dataset and graph the decision surface

### Day 2 (27-11-2021) : Naive Bayes mini-project & SVM
- Completed the Naive Bayes mini project to classify email with acc ~ 95.24%
- Started the lesson on Support Vector Machines SVM.

### Day 3 (28-11-21) : SVM mini-project, Linear Algebra & Decision Trees
- Completed the SVM mini-project with 99.08% accuracy using an `rbf` kernel 
- Completed Week 1 of Mathematics for [ML: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning), a course from Imperial College London on Coursera.
- Started the lesson on Decision Trees

### Day 4 (29-11-21) : Decision Tree, Entropy & Information gain
- Completed the Decision Tree mini-project

### Day 5 (30-11-21) : K-Nearest Neighbours, Datasets and Questions
- Learnt about the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier and implemented the same
- Completed the lesson on datasets and questions to gain key inferences
- Completed the lesson `WEB 3.0` from Siraj Raval's [Decentralized Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPVmd7SyKfQ) playlist
