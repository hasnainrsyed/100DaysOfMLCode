- Learnt the basics of a Naive Bayes classifier on the `iris` dataset
- Working on classifying the `Stanley Terrain` dataset and graph the decision surface

### Day 2 (27-11-2021) : Naive Bayes mini-project & SVM
- Completed the Naive Bayes mini project to classify email with acc ~ 95.24%
- Started the lesson on Support Vector Machines SVM.

### Day 3 (28-11-21) : SVM mini-project, Linear Algebra & Decision Trees
- Completed the SVM mini-project with 99.08% accuracy using an `rbf` kernel 
- Completed Week 1 of Mathematics for [ML: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning), a course from Imperial College London on Coursera.
